## Description

Given an array of URLs and a MAX_CONCURRENCY integer, implement a function that will asynchronously fetch each URL, not requesting more than MAX_CONCURRENCY URLs at the same time. The URLs should be fetched as soon as possible. The function should return an array of responses for each URL. How would you write a test for such a function?

## Run the code with example data:

```
node index.js
```

## Run the tests:

*Note: before first run jest dependency needs to be installed with `npm install`

```
npm run test
```
